# Safer Route

_A Collaborative Mapping Web-App_

Welcome to the Safer Route repository! Safer Route is a collaborative mapping web application designed to enhance safety awareness for pedestrians by providing insights into the perceived safety of urban roads, paths, and routes. This README will guide you through the project, its goals, features, and how to contribute.

## Introduction

Safer Route aims to empower users with the ability to make informed decisions about their routes in urban areas by leveraging data from various sources to assess the safety of different road segments and paths. The web-app combines both objective data, such as lighting levels and activity patterns, with subjective data derived from user ratings and feedback. This collaborative approach ensures that the safety information provided is comprehensive and up-to-date.


## Features

### 1. Interactive Mapping

The core feature of Safer Route is its interactive map interface. Users can explore urban areas, view different road segments, paths, and ways, and assess their safety levels based on color-coded indicators. Green indicates safer routes, while red suggests potential safety concerns.

### 2. Data Aggregation

Safer Route aggregates data from various sources, including public lighting databases, crime statistics, and user-generated ratings. By combining these datasets, the app provides a holistic view of safety.

### 3. User Ratings and Reviews

Users can contribute to the safety perception assessment by rating and reviewing specific road segments. This collaborative aspect allows individuals to share their experiences and insights, contributing to the overall safety evaluation.

### 4. Route Recommendations

Based on user preferences and safety concerns, Safer Route can suggest alternative routes that prioritize safety. This helps users make well-informed decisions when planning their journeys.
